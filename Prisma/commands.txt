[npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon

[npx prisma init --datasource-provider mongodb  //instead of mongodb use another database


when we create a model in schema.prisma like the User model we should apply them to my database
and migrate from what we had before:
[npx prisma migrate dev --name init 
dev is to say its for dev invironment and init is a name
this is not working in mongodb

we should update the client
the client will auto generate the codes to read update etc.
first add the client library:
[npm i @prisma/client
then we can manualy regenerate client:
[npx prisma generate
